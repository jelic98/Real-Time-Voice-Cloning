57-121074-0000 HE WAS CERTAINLY THE TALL YOUNG MAN WITH LIGHT HAIR RED BEARD BLACK EYES AND BRILLIANT COMPLEXION WHOM HIS MASTER HAD SO PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED TO HIM WHEN THE COUNT ENTERED THE ROOM THE YOUNG MAN WAS CARELESSLY STRETCHED ON A SOFA TAPPING HIS BOOT WITH THE GOLD HEADED CANE WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND
57-121074-0001 ON PERCEIVING THE COUNT HE ROSE QUICKLY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO I BELIEVE SAID HE YES SIR AND I THINK I HAVE THE HONOR OF ADDRESSING COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI REPEATED THE YOUNG MAN ACCOMPANYING HIS WORDS WITH A BOW
57-121074-0002 YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION ADDRESSED TO ME ARE YOU NOT SAID THE COUNT I DID NOT MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE SIGNATURE SEEMED TO ME SO STRANGE THE LETTER SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR IS IT NOT EXACTLY SO
57-121074-0003 WELL IT IS ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS AND A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE HE IS A VERY RICH ENGLISHMAN ECCENTRIC ALMOST TO INSANITY AND HIS REAL NAME IS LORD WILMORE AH INDEED THEN THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY SAID ANDREA
57-121074-0004 HE IS THEN THE SAME ENGLISHMAN WHOM I MET
57-121074-0005 WELL MONSIEUR I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
57-121074-0006 CERTAINLY I WILL DO SO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH A QUICKNESS WHICH GAVE PROOF OF HIS READY INVENTION I AM AS YOU HAVE SAID THE COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI SON OF MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI
57-121074-0007 A DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHOSE NAMES ARE INSCRIBED IN THE GOLDEN BOOK AT FLORENCE OUR FAMILY ALTHOUGH STILL RICH FOR MY FATHER'S INCOME AMOUNTS TO HALF A MILLION HAS EXPERIENCED MANY MISFORTUNES AND I MYSELF WAS AT THE AGE OF FIVE YEARS
57-121074-0008 TAKEN AWAY BY THE TREACHERY OF MY TUTOR SO THAT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE NOT SEEN THE AUTHOR OF MY EXISTENCE SINCE I HAVE ARRIVED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION AND BECOME MY OWN MASTER I HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY SEEKING HIM BUT ALL IN VAIN
57-121074-0009 AT LENGTH I RECEIVED THIS LETTER FROM YOUR FRIEND WHICH STATES THAT MY FATHER IS IN PARIS AND AUTHORIZES ME TO ADDRESS MYSELF TO YOU FOR INFORMATION RESPECTING HIM
57-121074-0010 AND YOU HAVE DONE WELL TO CONFORM IN EVERYTHING TO THE WISHES OF MY FRIEND SINBAD FOR YOUR FATHER IS INDEED HERE AND IS SEEKING YOU THE COUNT FROM THE MOMENT OF FIRST ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM HAD NOT ONCE LOST SIGHT OF THE EXPRESSION OF THE YOUNG MAN'S COUNTENANCE
57-121074-0011 HE HAD ADMIRED THE ASSURANCE OF HIS LOOK AND THE FIRMNESS OF HIS VOICE BUT AT THESE WORDS SO NATURAL IN THEMSELVES YOUR FATHER IS INDEED HERE AND IS SEEKING YOU YOUNG ANDREA STARTED AND EXCLAIMED MY FATHER IS MY FATHER HERE
57-121074-0012 MOST UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED MONTE CRISTO YOUR FATHER MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI THE EXPRESSION OF TERROR WHICH FOR THE MOMENT HAD OVERSPREAD THE FEATURES OF THE YOUNG MAN HAD NOW DISAPPEARED AH YES THAT IS THE NAME CERTAINLY
57-121074-0013 MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI AND YOU REALLY MEAN TO SAY MONSIEUR THAT MY DEAR FATHER IS HERE YES SIR AND I CAN EVEN ADD THAT I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIS COMPANY THE HISTORY WHICH HE RELATED TO ME OF HIS LOST SON TOUCHED ME TO THE QUICK
57-121074-0014 INDEED HIS GRIEFS HOPES AND FEARS ON THAT SUBJECT MIGHT FURNISH MATERIAL FOR A MOST TOUCHING AND PATHETIC POEM AT LENGTH HE ONE DAY RECEIVED A LETTER STATING THAT THE ABDUCTORS OF HIS SON NOW OFFERED TO RESTORE HIM OR AT LEAST TO GIVE NOTICE WHERE HE MIGHT BE FOUND
57-121074-0015 ON CONDITION OF RECEIVING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY BY WAY OF RANSOM YOUR FATHER DID NOT HESITATE AN INSTANT AND THE SUM WAS SENT TO THE FRONTIER OF PIEDMONT WITH A PASSPORT SIGNED FOR ITALY YOU WERE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE I THINK
57-121074-0016 YES REPLIED ANDREA WITH AN EMBARRASSED AIR I WAS IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE A CARRIAGE WAS TO AWAIT YOU AT NICE PRECISELY SO AND IT CONVEYED ME FROM NICE TO GENOA FROM GENOA TO TURIN
57-121074-0017 AND FROM PONT DE BEAUVOISIN TO PARIS INDEED THEN YOUR FATHER OUGHT TO HAVE MET WITH YOU ON THE ROAD FOR IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME ROUTE WHICH HE HIMSELF TOOK AND THAT IS HOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACE YOUR JOURNEY TO THIS PLACE
57-121074-0018 BUT SAID ANDREA IF MY FATHER HAD MET ME I DOUBT IF HE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ME I MUST BE SOMEWHAT ALTERED SINCE HE LAST SAW ME OH THE VOICE OF NATURE SAID MONTE CRISTO TRUE INTERRUPTED THE YOUNG MAN I HAD NOT LOOKED UPON IT IN THAT LIGHT
57-121074-0019 NOW REPLIED MONTE CRISTO THERE IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF UNEASINESS LEFT IN YOUR FATHER'S MIND WHICH IS THIS HE IS ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED DURING YOUR LONG ABSENCE FROM HIM HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BY YOUR PERSECUTORS
57-121074-0020 AND IF THEY HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES TOWARDS YOU WITH ALL THE DEFERENCE DUE TO YOUR RANK FINALLY HE IS ANXIOUS TO SEE IF YOU HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ESCAPE THE BAD MORAL INFLUENCE TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND WHICH IS INFINITELY MORE TO BE DREADED THAN ANY PHYSICAL SUFFERING
57-121074-0021 HE WISHES TO DISCOVER IF THE FINE ABILITIES WITH WHICH NATURE HAD ENDOWED YOU HAVE BEEN WEAKENED BY WANT OF CULTURE AND IN SHORT WHETHER YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF CAPABLE OF RESUMING AND RETAINING IN THE WORLD THE HIGH POSITION TO WHICH YOUR RANK ENTITLES YOU
57-121074-0022 I HOPE NO FALSE REPORT AS FOR MYSELF I FIRST HEARD YOU SPOKEN OF BY MY FRIEND WILMORE THE PHILANTHROPIST I BELIEVE HE FOUND YOU IN SOME UNPLEASANT POSITION BUT DO NOT KNOW OF WHAT NATURE FOR I DID NOT ASK NOT BEING INQUISITIVE
57-121074-0023 YOUR MISFORTUNES ENGAGED HIS SYMPATHIES SO YOU SEE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN INTERESTING HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO RESTORE YOU TO THE POSITION WHICH YOU HAD LOST AND THAT HE WOULD SEEK YOUR FATHER UNTIL HE FOUND HIM HE DID SEEK AND HAS FOUND HIM APPARENTLY SINCE HE IS HERE NOW
57-121074-0024 AND FINALLY MY FRIEND APPRISED ME OF YOUR COMING AND GAVE ME A FEW OTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATIVE TO YOUR FUTURE FORTUNE I AM QUITE AWARE THAT MY FRIEND WILMORE IS PECULIAR BUT HE IS SINCERE AND AS RICH AS A GOLD MINE
57-121074-0025 CONSEQUENTLY HE MAY INDULGE HIS ECCENTRICITIES WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF THEIR RUINING HIM AND I HAVE PROMISED TO ADHERE TO HIS INSTRUCTIONS NOW SIR PRAY DO NOT BE OFFENDED AT THE QUESTION I AM ABOUT TO PUT TO YOU AS IT COMES IN THE WAY OF MY DUTY AS YOUR PATRON
57-121074-0026 I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IF THE MISFORTUNES WHICH HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU MISFORTUNES ENTIRELY BEYOND YOUR CONTROL AND WHICH IN NO DEGREE DIMINISH MY REGARD FOR YOU
57-121074-0027 I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE NOT IN SOME MEASURE CONTRIBUTED TO RENDER YOU A STRANGER TO THE WORLD IN WHICH YOUR FORTUNE AND YOUR NAME ENTITLE YOU TO MAKE A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE SIR RETURNED THE YOUNG MAN WITH A REASSURANCE OF MANNER
57-121074-0028 MAKE YOUR MIND EASY ON THIS SCORE THOSE WHO TOOK ME FROM MY FATHER AND WHO ALWAYS INTENDED SOONER OR LATER TO SELL ME AGAIN TO MY ORIGINAL PROPRIETOR AS THEY HAVE NOW DONE CALCULATED THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR BARGAIN IT WOULD BE POLITIC TO LEAVE ME IN POSSESSION OF ALL MY PERSONAL
57-121074-0029 AND HEREDITARY WORTH AND EVEN TO INCREASE THE VALUE IF POSSIBLE I HAVE THEREFORE RECEIVED A VERY GOOD EDUCATION AND HAVE BEEN TREATED BY THESE KIDNAPPERS VERY MUCH AS THE SLAVES WERE TREATED IN ASIA MINOR WHOSE MASTERS MADE THEM GRAMMARIANS DOCTORS AND PHILOSOPHERS
57-121074-0030 IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT FETCH A HIGHER PRICE IN THE ROMAN MARKET MONTE CRISTO SMILED WITH SATISFACTION
57-121074-0031 I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE EXCUSED IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MISFORTUNES WHICH ACCOMPANIED MY BIRTH AND FOLLOWED ME THROUGH MY YOUTH WELL SAID MONTE CRISTO IN AN INDIFFERENT TONE YOU WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE COUNT FOR YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR OWN ACTIONS AND ARE THE PERSON MOST CONCERNED IN THE MATTER
57-121074-0032 BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULD NOT DIVULGE A WORD OF THESE ADVENTURES YOUR HISTORY IS QUITE A ROMANCE AND THE WORLD WHICH DELIGHTS IN ROMANCES IN YELLOW COVERS STRANGELY MISTRUSTS THOSE WHICH ARE BOUND IN LIVING PARCHMENT EVEN THOUGH THEY BE GILDED LIKE YOURSELF
57-121074-0033 THIS IS THE KIND OF DIFFICULTY WHICH I WISHED TO REPRESENT TO YOU MY DEAR COUNT YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE RECITED YOUR TOUCHING HISTORY BEFORE IT WOULD GO FORTH TO THE WORLD AND BE DEEMED UNLIKELY AND UNNATURAL
57-121074-0034 YOU WOULD BE NO LONGER A LOST CHILD FOUND BUT YOU WOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS AN UPSTART WHO HAD SPRUNG UP LIKE A MUSHROOM IN THE NIGHT YOU MIGHT EXCITE A LITTLE CURIOSITY
57-121074-0035 AND THE SUBJECT OF UNPLEASANT REMARK I AGREE WITH YOU MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG MAN TURNING PALE AND IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TREMBLING BENEATH THE SCRUTINIZING LOOK OF HIS COMPANION SUCH CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT
57-121074-0036 NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THE EVIL SAID MONTE CRISTO FOR BY ENDEAVORING TO AVOID ONE FAULT YOU WILL FALL INTO ANOTHER YOU MUST RESOLVE UPON ONE SIMPLE AND SINGLE LINE OF CONDUCT
57-121074-0037 AND FOR A MAN OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE THIS PLAN IS AS EASY AS IT IS NECESSARY YOU MUST FORM HONORABLE FRIENDSHIPS AND BY THAT MEANS COUNTERACT THE PREJUDICE WHICH MAY ATTACH TO THE OBSCURITY OF YOUR FORMER LIFE ANDREA VISIBLY CHANGED COUNTENANCE
57-121074-0038 I WOULD OFFER MYSELF AS YOUR SURETY AND FRIENDLY ADVISER SAID MONTE CRISTO DID I NOT POSSESS A MORAL DISTRUST OF MY BEST FRIENDS AND A SORT OF INCLINATION TO LEAD OTHERS TO DOUBT THEM TOO THEREFORE IN DEPARTING FROM THIS RULE I SHOULD AS THE ACTORS SAY
57-121074-0039 BE PLAYING A PART QUITE OUT OF MY LINE AND SHOULD THEREFORE RUN THE RISK OF BEING HISSED WHICH WOULD BE AN ACT OF FOLLY HOWEVER YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID ANDREA IN CONSIDERATION OF LORD WILMORE BY WHOM I WAS RECOMMENDED TO YOU YES CERTAINLY INTERRUPTED MONTE CRISTO
57-121074-0040 THAT THE SEASON OF YOUR YOUTH WAS RATHER A STORMY ONE AH SAID THE COUNT WATCHING ANDREA'S COUNTENANCE I DO NOT DEMAND ANY CONFESSION FROM YOU IT IS PRECISELY TO AVOID THAT NECESSITY THAT YOUR FATHER WAS SENT FOR FROM LUCCA YOU SHALL SOON SEE HIM
57-121074-0041 HE IS A LITTLE STIFF AND POMPOUS IN HIS MANNER AND HE IS DISFIGURED BY HIS UNIFORM BUT WHEN IT BECOMES KNOWN THAT HE HAS BEEN FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE AUSTRIAN SERVICE ALL THAT WILL BE PARDONED WE ARE NOT GENERALLY VERY SEVERE WITH THE AUSTRIANS
57-121074-0042 IN SHORT YOU WILL FIND YOUR FATHER A VERY PRESENTABLE PERSON I ASSURE YOU AH SIR YOU HAVE GIVEN ME CONFIDENCE IT IS SO LONG SINCE WE WERE SEPARATED THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST REMEMBRANCE OF HIM AND BESIDES YOU KNOW THAT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD A LARGE FORTUNE COVERS ALL DEFECTS
57-121074-0043 HE IS A MILLIONAIRE HIS INCOME IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH ANXIETY I SHALL BE SURE TO BE PLACED IN AN AGREEABLE POSITION ONE OF THE MOST AGREEABLE POSSIBLE MY DEAR SIR
57-121074-0044 THEN IN THAT CASE I SHALL ALWAYS CHOOSE TO REMAIN THERE YOU CANNOT CONTROL CIRCUMSTANCES MY DEAR SIR MAN PROPOSES AND GOD DISPOSES ANDREA SIGHED BUT SAID HE
57-121074-0045 SO LONG AS I DO REMAIN IN PARIS AND NOTHING FORCES ME TO QUIT IT DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT I MAY RELY ON RECEIVING THE SUM YOU JUST NOW MENTIONED TO ME
57-121074-0046 ASKED ANDREA WITH SOME UNEASINESS YES YOU WILL RECEIVE IT FROM YOUR FATHER PERSONALLY BUT LORD WILMORE WILL BE THE SECURITY FOR THE MONEY HE HAS AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR FATHER OPENED AN ACCOUNT OF SIX THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH
57-121074-0047 WHICH IS ONE OF THE SAFEST BANKS IN PARIS AND DOES MY FATHER MEAN TO REMAIN LONG IN PARIS ASKED ANDREA ONLY A FEW DAYS REPLIED MONTE CRISTO HIS SERVICE DOES NOT ALLOW HIM TO ABSENT HIMSELF MORE THAN TWO OR THREE WEEKS TOGETHER AH MY DEAR FATHER
57-121074-0048 EXCLAIMED ANDREA EVIDENTLY CHARMED WITH THE IDEA OF HIS SPEEDY DEPARTURE THEREFORE SAID MONTE CRISTO FEIGNING TO MISTAKE HIS MEANING THEREFORE I WILL NOT FOR ANOTHER INSTANT RETARD THE PLEASURE OF YOUR MEETING ARE YOU PREPARED TO EMBRACE YOUR WORTHY FATHER
57-121074-0049 I HOPE YOU DO NOT DOUBT IT GO THEN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MY YOUNG FRIEND WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR FATHER AWAITING YOU ANDREA MADE A LOW BOW TO THE COUNT AND ENTERED THE ADJOINING ROOM MONTE CRISTO WATCHED HIM TILL HE DISAPPEARED
57-121074-0050 AND THEN TOUCHED A SPRING IN A PANEL MADE TO LOOK LIKE A PICTURE WHICH IN SLIDING PARTLY FROM THE FRAME DISCOVERED TO VIEW A SMALL OPENING SO CLEVERLY CONTRIVED THAT IT REVEALED ALL THAT WAS PASSING IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOW OCCUPIED BY CAVALCANTI AND ANDREA
57-121074-0051 THE YOUNG MAN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE MAJOR WHO HAD RISEN WHEN HE HEARD STEPS APPROACHING HIM AH MY DEAR FATHER SAID ANDREA IN A LOUD VOICE IN ORDER THAT THE COUNT MIGHT HEAR HIM IN THE NEXT ROOM IS IT REALLY YOU
57-121074-0052 HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR SON SAID THE MAJOR GRAVELY AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF PAINFUL SEPARATION SAID ANDREA IN THE SAME TONE OF VOICE AND GLANCING TOWARDS THE DOOR WHAT A HAPPINESS IT IS TO MEET AGAIN
57-121074-0053 WILL YOU NOT EMBRACE ME SIR SAID ANDREA IF YOU WISH IT MY SON SAID THE MAJOR AND THE TWO MEN EMBRACED EACH OTHER AFTER THE FASHION OF ACTORS ON THE STAGE THAT IS TO SAY EACH RESTED HIS HEAD ON THE OTHER'S SHOULDER
57-121074-0054 THEN WE ARE ONCE MORE REUNITED SAID ANDREA ONCE MORE REPLIED THE MAJOR NEVER MORE TO BE SEPARATED
57-121074-0055 WHY AS TO THAT I THINK MY DEAR SON YOU MUST BE BY THIS TIME SO ACCUSTOMED TO FRANCE AS TO LOOK UPON IT ALMOST AS A SECOND COUNTRY THE FACT IS SAID THE YOUNG MAN THAT I SHOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GRIEVED TO LEAVE IT
57-121074-0056 AS FOR ME YOU MUST KNOW I CANNOT POSSIBLY LIVE OUT OF LUCCA THEREFORE I SHALL RETURN TO ITALY AS SOON AS I CAN BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE FRANCE MY DEAR FATHER I HOPE YOU WILL PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF THE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVE MY DESCENT
57-121074-0057 CERTAINLY I AM COME EXPRESSLY ON THAT ACCOUNT IT HAS COST ME MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND YOU BUT I HAD RESOLVED ON GIVING THEM INTO YOUR HANDS AND IF I HAD TO RECOMMENCE MY SEARCH IT WOULD OCCUPY ALL THE FEW REMAINING YEARS OF MY LIFE WHERE ARE THESE PAPERS THEN
57-121074-0058 HERE THEY ARE ANDREA SEIZED THE CERTIFICATE OF HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE AND HIS OWN BAPTISMAL REGISTER AND AFTER HAVING OPENED THEM WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS WHICH MIGHT BE EXPECTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE READ THEM WITH A FACILITY WHICH PROVED THAT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIMILAR DOCUMENTS
57-121074-0059 AND WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH PLAINLY DENOTED AN UNUSUAL INTEREST IN THE CONTENTS WHEN HE HAD PERUSED THE DOCUMENTS AN INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE LIGHTED UP HIS COUNTENANCE AND LOOKING AT THE MAJOR WITH A MOST PECULIAR SMILE HE SAID IN VERY EXCELLENT TUSCAN
57-121074-0060 THEN THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SUCH THING IN ITALY AS BEING CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS THE MAJOR DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
57-121074-0061 I MEAN THAT IF THERE WERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW UP WITH IMPUNITY TWO SUCH DEEDS AS THESE IN FRANCE MY DEAR SIR HALF SUCH A PIECE OF EFFRONTERY AS THAT WOULD CAUSE YOU TO BE QUICKLY DESPATCHED TO TOULON FOR FIVE YEARS FOR CHANGE OF AIR
57-121074-0062 WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN YOUR MEANING SAID THE MAJOR ENDEAVORING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ASSUME AN AIR OF THE GREATEST MAJESTY
57-121074-0063 SAID ANDREA TAKING THE MAJOR BY THE ARM IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER HOW MUCH ARE YOU PAID FOR BEING MY FATHER THE MAJOR WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN ANDREA CONTINUED IN A LOW VOICE NONSENSE I AM GOING TO SET YOU AN EXAMPLE OF CONFIDENCE
57-121074-0064 THEY GIVE ME FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR TO BE YOUR SON CONSEQUENTLY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY I SHALL EVER DENY MY PARENT THE MAJOR LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND HIM MAKE YOURSELF EASY WE ARE QUITE ALONE SAID ANDREA

57-121074-0067 YOU THINK THEN THAT I MAY RELY ON THE COUNT'S PROMISES CERTAINLY I DO YOU ARE SURE HE WILL KEEP HIS WORD WITH ME TO THE LETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBER WE MUST CONTINUE TO PLAY OUR RESPECTIVE PARTS I AS A TENDER FATHER
