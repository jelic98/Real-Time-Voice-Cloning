57-121742-0000 ONE GLORIOUS MORNING IN EARLY SUMMER I FOUND MYSELF LED BY THE UNGENTLE HAND OF MISSUS MITCHELL TOWARDS A LITTLE SCHOOL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VILLAGE KEPT BY AN OLD WOMAN CALLED MISSUS SHAND IN AN ENGLISH VILLAGE I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED DAME SHAND
57-121742-0001 WE CALLED HER LUCKIE SHAND HALF DRAGGED ALONG THE ROAD BY MISSUS MITCHELL FROM WHOSE ROUGH GRASP I ATTEMPTED IN VAIN TO EXTRICATE MY HAND I LOOKED AROUND AT THE SHINING FIELDS AND UP AT THE BLUE SKY
57-121742-0002 WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE DESPAIR OF A MAN GOING TO THE GALLOWS AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO THE WORLD WE HAD TO CROSS A LITTLE STREAM AND WHEN WE REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOT BRIDGE I TUGGED YET AGAIN AT MY IMPRISONED HAND WITH A HALF FORMED INTENTION OF THROWING MYSELF INTO THE BROOK
57-121742-0003 BUT MY EFFORTS WERE STILL UNAVAILING OVER A HALF MILE OR SO RENDERED WEARY BY UNWILLINGNESS I WAS LED TO THE COTTAGE DOOR
57-121742-0004 BUT A DREARY LITTLE HOUSE WITH NOTHING GREEN TO COVER THE BROWN STONES OF WHICH IT WAS BUILT AND HAVING AN OPEN DITCH IN FRONT OF IT WITH A STONE SLAB OVER IT FOR A BRIDGE DID I SAY THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE WALLS THIS MORNING THERE WAS THE LOVELIEST SUNSHINE
57-121742-0005 AND THAT I WAS GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND IT WAS VERY BITTER ESPECIALLY AS I HAD EXPECTED TO GO WITH MY ELDER BROTHER TO SPEND THE DAY AT A NEIGHBOURING FARM MISSUS MITCHELL OPENED THE DOOR AND LED ME IN IT WAS AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE DAME SHAND STOOD AT HER TABLE IRONING
57-121742-0006 SHE WAS AS TALL AS MISSUS MITCHELL AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO PREJUDICE ME AGAINST HER AT ONCE SHE WORE A CLOSE FITTING WIDOW'S CAP WITH A BLACK RIBBON ROUND IT HER HAIR WAS GREY AND HER FACE WAS AS GREY AS HER HAIR
57-121742-0007 AND HER SKIN WAS GATHERED IN WRINKLES ABOUT HER MOUTH WHERE THEY TWITCHED AND TWITCHED AS IF SHE WERE CONSTANTLY MEDITATING SOMETHING UNPLEASANT SHE LOOKED UP INQUIRINGLY I'VE BROUGHT YOU A NEW SCHOLAR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL WELL VERY WELL
57-121742-0008 SAID THE DAME IN A DUBIOUS TONE I HOPE HE'S A GOOD BOY FOR HE MUST BE GOOD IF HE COMES HERE WELL HE'S JUST MIDDLING HIS FATHER SPARES THE ROD MISSUS SHAND AND WE KNOW WHAT COMES OF THAT THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR TALK WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN RECALL IT
57-121742-0009 WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO NONE BUT THE TWO WOMEN THEMSELVES MEANTIME I WAS MAKING WHAT OBSERVATIONS MY TERROR WOULD ALLOW ABOUT A DOZEN CHILDREN WERE SEATED ON FORMS ALONG THE WALLS LOOKING OVER THE TOPS OF THEIR SPELLING BOOKS AT THE NEWCOMER
57-121742-0010 IN THE FARTHER CORNER TWO WERE KICKING AT EACH OTHER AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED LOOKING VERY ANGRY BUT NOT DARING TO CRY MY NEXT DISCOVERY WAS TERRIBLY DISCONCERTING SOME MOVEMENT DREW MY EYES TO THE FLOOR THERE I SAW A BOY OF MY OWN AGE ON ALL FOURS
57-121742-0011 FASTENED BY A STRING TO A LEG OF THE TABLE AT WHICH THE DAME WAS IRONING WHILE HORRIBLE TO RELATE A DOG NOT VERY BIG BUT VERY UGLY AND BIG ENOUGH TO BE FRIGHTENED AT LAY UNDER THE TABLE WATCHING HIM I GAZED IN UTTER DISMAY
57-121742-0012 AH YOU MAY LOOK SAID THE DAME IF YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BOY THAT IS HOW YOU SHALL BE SERVED THE DOG SHALL HAVE YOU TO LOOK AFTER I TREMBLED AND WAS SPEECHLESS AFTER SOME FURTHER CONFABULATION MISSUS MITCHELL TOOK HER LEAVE SAYING
57-121742-0013 I'LL COME BACK FOR HIM AT ONE O'CLOCK AND IF I DON'T COME JUST KEEP HIM TILL I DO COME THE DAME ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE DOOR AND THEN I DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS LAME AND HOBBLED VERY MUCH A RESOLUTION AROSE FULL FORMED IN MY BRAIN
57-121742-0014 I SAT DOWN ON THE FORM NEAR THE DOOR AND KEPT VERY QUIET HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTENTION I CHERISHED I AM SURE I SHOULD HAVE CRIED WHEN THE DAME RETURNED SHE RESUMED HER BOX IRON IN WHICH THE HEATER WENT RATTLING ABOUT
57-121742-0015 AS STANDING ON ONE LEG THE OTHER WAS SO MUCH SHORTER SHE MOVED IT TO AND FRO OVER THE GARMENT ON THE TABLE THEN SHE CALLED ME TO HER BY NAME IN A WOULD BE POMPOUS MANNER I OBEYED TREMBLING CAN YOU SAY YOUR LETTERS
57-121742-0016 SHE ASKED NOW ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT READ I COULD REPEAT THE ALPHABET HOW I HAD LEARNED IT I DO NOT KNOW I DID REPEAT IT HOW MANY QUESTIONS OF YOUR CATECHISM CAN YOU SAY SHE ASKED NEXT
57-121742-0017 NOT KNOWING WITH CERTAINTY WHAT SHE MEANT I WAS SILENT NO SULKING SAID THE DAME AND OPENING A DRAWER IN THE TABLE SHE TOOK OUT A CATECHISM TURNING BACK THE COVER SHE PUT IT IN MY HAND AND TOLD ME TO LEARN THE FIRST QUESTION
57-121742-0018 SHE HAD NOT EVEN INQUIRED WHETHER I COULD READ I TOOK THE CATECHISM AND STOOD AS BEFORE GO TO YOUR SEAT SHE SAID I OBEYED AND WITH THE BOOK BEFORE ME PONDERED MY PLAN
57-121742-0019 EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON WHETHER I COULD OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE SHE COULD REACH ME ONCE OUT OF THE HOUSE I WAS SURE OF RUNNING FASTER THAN SHE COULD FOLLOW AND SOON I HAD MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF HOW THOSE ARE HELPED WHO WILL HELP THEMSELVES
57-121742-0020 THE IRONING OF COURSE REQUIRED A FIRE TO MAKE THE IRONS HOT AND AS THE MORNING WENT ON THE SUNSHINE ON THE WALLS CONSPIRING WITH THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH MADE THE PLACE TOO HOT FOR THE COMFORT OF THE OLD DAME SHE WENT AND SET THE DOOR WIDE OPEN
57-121742-0021 I WAS INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT WATCHING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY ONE SOON OCCURRED A CLASS OF SOME FIVE OR SIX WAS READING IF READING IT COULD BE CALLED OUT OF THE BIBLE AT LENGTH IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ONE WHO BLUNDERED DREADFULLY
57-121742-0022 IT WAS THE SAME BOY WHO HAD BEEN TIED UNDER THE TABLE BUT HE HAD BEEN RELEASED FOR HIS LESSON THE DAME HOBBLED TO HIM AND FOUND HE HAD HIS BOOK UPSIDE DOWN WHEREUPON SHE TURNED IN WRATH TO THE TABLE AND TOOK FROM THE DRAWER A LONG LEATHER STRAP
57-121742-0023 WITH WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO CHASTISE HIM AS HIS FIRST CRY REACHED MY EARS I WAS HALFWAY TO THE DOOR ON THE THRESHOLD I STUMBLED AND FELL
57-121742-0024 I HEARD WITH HORROR BUT I WAS UP AND OFF IN A MOMENT I HAD NOT HOWEVER GOT MANY YARDS FROM THE COTTAGE BEFORE I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE DAME SCREAMING AFTER ME TO RETURN I TOOK NO HEED ONLY SPED THE FASTER
57-121742-0025 BUT WHAT WAS MY HORROR TO FIND HER COMMAND ENFORCED BY THE PURSUING BARK OF HER PRIME MINISTER THIS PARALYSED ME I TURNED AND THERE WAS THE FIENDISH LOOKING DOG CLOSE ON MY HEELS I COULD RUN NO LONGER
57-121742-0026 THE NEXT MOMENT A WHOLESOME RAGE SENT THE BLOOD TO MY BRAIN FROM ABJECT COWARDICE TO WILD ATTACK I CANNOT CALL IT COURAGE WAS THE CHANGE OF AN INSTANT I RUSHED TOWARDS THE LITTLE WRETCH I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT HIM
57-121742-0027 BUT IN DESPERATION I THREW MYSELF UPON HIM AND DUG MY NAILS INTO HIM THEY HAD FORTUNATELY FOUND THEIR WAY TO HIS EYES HE WAS THE VERIEST COWARD OF HIS SPECIES HE YELPED AND HOWLED AND STRUGGLING FROM MY GRASP RAN WITH HIS TAIL MERGED IN HIS PERSON BACK TO HIS MISTRESS
57-121742-0028 WHO WAS HOBBLING AFTER ME BUT WITH THE RENEWED STRENGTH OF TRIUMPH I TURNED AGAIN FOR HOME AND RAN AS I HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE WHEN OR WHERE THE DAME GAVE IN I DO NOT KNOW
57-121742-0029 AND THERE I BURST OUT SOBBING AND CRYING IT WAS ALL THE UTTERANCE I HAD LEFT AS SOON AS KIRSTY HAD SUCCEEDED IN CALMING ME I TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY SHE SAID VERY LITTLE BUT I COULD SEE SHE WAS VERY ANGRY NO DOUBT SHE WAS PONDERING WHAT COULD BE DONE
57-121742-0030 SHE GOT ME SOME MILK HALF CREAM I DO BELIEVE IT WAS SO NICE AND SOME OATCAKE AND WENT ON WITH HER WORK WHILE I ATE I REFLECTED THAT ANY MOMENT MISSUS MITCHELL MIGHT APPEAR TO DRAG ME BACK IN DISGRACE TO THAT HORRIBLE DEN
57-121742-0031 I KNEW THAT KIRSTY'S AUTHORITY WAS NOT EQUAL TO HERS AND THAT SHE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO GIVE ME UP SO I WATCHED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE ONCE MORE AND HIDE MYSELF SO THAT KIRSTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS
57-121742-0032 WHEN I HAD FINISHED AND KIRSTY HAD LEFT THE KITCHEN FOR A MOMENT I SPED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE FARMYARD THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN DARK AND BROWN AND COOL THE DOOR OF THE BARN STOOD OPEN AS IF INVITING ME TO SHELTER AND SAFETY
57-121742-0033 FOR I KNEW THAT IN THE DARKEST END OF IT LAY A GREAT HEAP OF OAT STRAW I SPED ACROSS THE INTERVENING SUNSHINE INTO THE DARKNESS AND BEGAN BURROWING IN THE STRAW LIKE A WILD ANIMAL DRAWING OUT HANDFULS AND LAYING THEM CAREFULLY ASIDE SO THAT NO DISORDER SHOULD BETRAY MY RETREAT
57-121742-0034 WHEN I HAD MADE A HOLE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ME I GOT IN BUT KEPT DRAWING OUT THE STRAW BEHIND ME AND FILLING THE HOLE IN FRONT THIS I CONTINUED UNTIL I HAD NOT ONLY STOPPED UP THE ENTRANCE BUT PLACED A GOOD THICKNESS OF STRAW BETWEEN ME AND THE OUTSIDE
57-121742-0035 BY THE TIME I HAD BURROWED AS FAR AS I THOUGHT NECESSARY I WAS TIRED AND LAY DOWN AT FULL LENGTH IN MY HOLE DELIGHTING IN SUCH A SENSE OF SAFETY AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED
